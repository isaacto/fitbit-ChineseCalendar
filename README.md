Chinese Calendar

Display the same day in both the western (Gregorian) and Chinese lunar
calendar.

  * Move forward and backward by 1 day, 7 days, 30 days or 365 days by
    swiping on the dates.
  * Set solar or lunar calendar by tapping on the dates.
  * Move to today by the button.

Unluckily, some of the year names are not displayable in Versa if
written correctly, so they are substituted with a character looking
similar.  You're warned.
